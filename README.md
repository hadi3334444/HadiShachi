#HadiShachi Paper
This Respository contains the Matlab code for comparing 13 methods of image thresholding. Almost all of them are entropy based such as:
* Shannon Entropy
* Tsallis Entropy
* Masi Entropy
* Renyi Entropy
I have downloaded those images from the below link,

We have modified some methods such as Nie, Sahoo, Kapur, YanLi, and Rodrigues and named them SAD before their names you can find them in codes also
